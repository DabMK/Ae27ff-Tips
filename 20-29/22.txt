This level is pretty hard: you need to analyze the image, and find the rar file hidden into the hex data (use HxD program to find that), searching for magic bytes in it
Then, you have 2 paths: dictionary attack the rar or look at the source code of the page, that tells you to look at "both the heads", refering to the response's headers of that page
