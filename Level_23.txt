This level is extremely hard: the tip in the source codes decodes in another very hard cipher, so you have to take another path.
You can complete this level by injecting in the developer console a bruteforce attack for the code, written in javascript:

for (var i = 0; i < 999999999; i++)
{
    document.getElementById("input").value = i;
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1)); // Wait for the other JS to change the src
    if (document.getElementById("light").src.includes("bulb_1")) { console.log("CODE: " + i); break; }
}

You need to replace "bulb_1" with "bulb_2" and "bulb_3" to find the other parts of the code, when you have found the first one, using a slightly different code:

var con = "codeFound";
for (var i = 0; i < 999999999; i++)
{
    document.getElementById("input").value = con + i.toString();
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1)); // Wait for the other JS to change the src
    if (document.getElementById("light").src.includes("bulb_2")) { console.log("CODE: " + con + i.toString()); break; }
}

Replace codeFound with the code that the previous code gave you and then, when you have found the 2nd part of the code, change "bulb_2" to "bulb_3" and update the var "con"
When the script will find the 3rd part of the code, the input box under the code input should contain the initials of the word you are searching for to continue to level 24.
Find the initials and try every word in the english alphabet starting with those letters (there are only a few)
