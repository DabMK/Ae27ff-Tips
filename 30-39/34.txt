Level 34 contains a text that changes every second, repeating each hour (so basically 3600 different strings). Below there's a suggestion about the cipher used (m=minute, s=second).
In the source code, the puzzle tells us that once per hour (UTC), the text will be completely readable.
Looking at the suggestion, we can assume that the cipher is a substitution cipher and that the current time (minute and second) is the shift key.
What would minute and second need to look like to see the plain string? (To "cancel" the shift)
