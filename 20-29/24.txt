Level 24 is not easy at all. The given text is in Vigenere Cipher and, in order to decode it, you need to know how it works.
Looking at the source page code will reveal that the result have to be padded with "z" and doing a Kasiski's Test on the text will tell you that the password should be 6 characters long.
I suggest you to use "https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher" or "https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" website to decode it.
So, in order to find a 6 character key that gives a text padded with "z", you need to put the "z" as the key, and then find a pattern in the result.
Once found the important word in the pattern, use it as key and find the padded text, that reveals the password
