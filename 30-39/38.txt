First of all we can download an image; looking at the EXIF data, we see a hint. Here Google would be useful to find out the first thing that the hint tell us to find.
By combining it with the second thing, we can find a cipher. Putting the number we have been told in the hint in the cipher, we get a list of numbers.
There is some "hidden hex data" in the image, padded with some repeated hex values. Removing the padding, we obtain another list.
We can notice that the lists are the same size; now we need to do a calculation:
(first item of hidden data in image to decimal code - first item of the other list) % 256  (Since the lists are pretty long it's faster with a script).
Then convert what you got to ASCII and you should have a string, telling the shift of the text present in the level's page.
Subtracting that shift and doing %256 to each value, we obtain another string telling us to do something. Do that thing and finally go to the next level.
