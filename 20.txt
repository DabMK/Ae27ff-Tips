As you can deduct from the given text, there are 3 files named "greenpurple.bin", "gpmsg.bin" and "gpinfo.txt". The tip in the source says "xor".
To solve this level, you need to use XOR (I suggest using the "https://cyber.meme.tips/xorjs/" website).
As the .txt file states, you need to offset a file by 293 bytes. You obviously need to do that with the biggest .bin file, because the other one doesn't even contain 293 bytes.
Finally, combine inputs and read the given output file
