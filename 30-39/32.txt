First of all, we can decode the message encrypted in the source code. Keep in mind that ROT cipher can be bruteforced.
Then tune the radio to the right frequence and download the file. Extract the text from that file, identify the cipher and tune the radio to this other value.
Download the new audio and search for EXIF data and find the 2 messages with both the frequency analysis methods (TIP: listen at some MFSK128 samples to identify it in the audio)
Then use the Mono-alphabetic Substitution cipher with the data you have and remember the message you have decrypted found in the source code
