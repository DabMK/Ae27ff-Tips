First of all we can download an image; looking at the EXIF data, we see a hint. Here Google would be useful to find out the first thing that the hint tell us to find.
By combining it with the second thing, we can find a cipher. Putting the number we have been told in the hint in the cipher, we get a list of numbers.
There is some "hidden hex data" in the image, padded with some repeated hex values. Removing the padding, we obtain another list.
We can notice that the 2 lists have a same size; now we need to do a calculation:
(first item of hidden data in image to decimal code - first item of the other list) % 256  (Since the lists are pretty long it's faster with a script).
Then convert what you got to ASCII and you should have a text, telling the shift of the text present in the level's page.
HINT: for some weird reason, some the last word can be trimmed out while decoding; it is "value)".
OTHER HINT: many different languages, treat differently the % operator. In this case, we want to use Python.
Subtracting that shift and applying %256 to each value, we obtain another string telling us to do something. Do that thing and finally go to the next level.
