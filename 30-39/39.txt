First of all we can notice a text encryped in a certain base. Decoding it to base10 and then ASCII, we get an encrypted string.
Decoding this string from Vigenere isn't easy though. You need to try different part of keys until you understand the first 2 words (they're easy english words)
Hint: this website can help you "https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher". Find the first part of the key that gives you the first 2 words correctly.
Once found, try to complete the key (it's an english word) and decode the text. Tip: Looking at the title can help you.
Now look at the decoded text: the world stands for the external arrows and x and y are the coordinates.
Since there are the same number of external white and red arrows, you'll get 2 coordinates.
EXAMPLE: if there were 5 up red arrows, 3 down white arrows, 5 down red arrows and 3 up white arrows, the coordinates would be 5;3 and 3;5.
Set the origin (0;0) to up left and find the 2 arrows corrisponding to the 2 coordinates. Follow the arrows and get the "path".
Finally, sum the 2 numbers and do what the decoded vigenere text said to do.
