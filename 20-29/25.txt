You can find a Base64 text in the comments, that decodes into a weird string. With "https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier" website, you can find the cipher of that string.
Decode the string with the cipher and play the minigame as the decoded text says.
Map of the minigame:

  Win         (Wood2)              
   |             |                     
Tunnel2        Pond2-----(Wood2)        
   |             |          |          
Tunnel---------Pond       Wood3-----(Pond)
                            |
              (Wood3)     Wood2-----Wood6
                 |          |
               Wood5------Wood------Wood4
                            |
           Living Room----Cabin   Closet
                 |                   |
              Kitchen-----Hall-----Hall2
                            |
                           Bear

THE MAP IS SLIGHTLY INCORRECT BECAUSE SOME REDIRECTS WORK IN A WEIRD WAY
Thing inside brackets are "redirects"
Before visiting "Tunnel", you need to visit "Pond2"
Before playing as the decoded text says and going to "Win" (follow the decoded text and not the map, it's more correct), make sure to visit the bear and go in the closet more times
