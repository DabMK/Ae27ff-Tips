This very hard level is all about cryptography: you know the process used to encrypt a string and you know 3 examples.
Write a script in any language that does that process backwards and check that the examples corrispond. NOTE: There might be more correct solutions with the examples, just use the easier one you'll come up with.
Then you will need to add the shift and split each word in 2 different cases: if the initial number is odd or if it is even (we can't know that)
You will obtain 2 weird strings. Try to replace characters without changing their positions around the 2 strings until you'll obtain a comprehensible string
