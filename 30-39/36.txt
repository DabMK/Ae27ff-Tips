First of all look at the image: notice any EXIF data? Use the website "https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher" to bruteforce the vigenere code
Because in this case dCode doesn't work. Once decoded, look at the file's structure. You can also use some tools to do that. Notice anything weird?
The decoded vigenere text should tell you a cipher and a key. Use that cipher and that key to decode the image's "hidden data" and treat it as the type of file told in the second word of the decoded vigenere
Once obtained this file, use a decompiler to analyze it (I personally suggest "https://jdec.app/").
Since it's almost impossible to crack Math.random(), try to find a way to "force" the event for the correct password.
Additional tip: the .jar may break if you try to edit it; in that case, make a new java project and import the important files to crack the event
